# Upgrading the SDK

Move a project to a newer SDK release in this order:

1. Change the tag in `package.json`: the builder's reference ends in `#sdk-vX.Y.Z&path:packages/agentflow-app-builder`
   (and the other `@reflexify/agentflow-*` references, if the project has them), to the same new tag. The reference
   changes with the tag: `#sdk-v0.4.1&path:…` becomes `#sdk-v0.5.0&path:…`, and every `@reflexify/agentflow-*` entry in
   `dependencies` and `devDependencies` names the same one.
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm build`, which rewrites `package/` with the new builder.
4. `pnpm check` (`build --check` only), then `pnpm exec agentflow-app lint`. If the project commits generated types, also `pnpm exec agentflow-app types --check` (a project without them: see "Adopting the pieces a newer starter ships" below).
5. `pnpm seal`.

Step 5 can answer `SEAL_OUT_EXISTS`: a new SDK can write other bytes for the same package, so the `.afpkg` already in
`dist-app/` for this `version` now differs. What to do depends on whether that version ever reached AgentFlow:

- **Never uploaded** (only `seal` ran, or `lint`, which sends `package/` and stores nothing; a version is stored once it is uploaded, by `deploy`, `publish` or on the admin's packages page): delete the old
  `dist-app/<prefix>-<key>-<version>.afpkg` and seal again.
- **Uploaded** (a `deploy` reached AgentFlow, even one never approved, or an admin uploaded the file on the packages page): your organization holds that
  version, and an upload of other contents under it is refused with `APP_PACKAGE_VERSION_EXISTS`. A `publish` stores it the same way, so
  other contents under a published version are refused with the same `APP_PACKAGE_VERSION_EXISTS`. Deleting the file
  does not help. Raise `version` in `config/package-manifest.json`, build, seal, deploy.
- Unsure: raise `version`. It costs nothing.

## Adopting the pieces a newer starter ships

A project made from an older starter does not gain the new starter's files by upgrading. For the generated types
(the starter has had them since 0.4.0), a project that has a UI module does this once:

1. `pnpm build`, then `pnpm exec agentflow-app types`: it writes `src/generated/app.ts` from `package/`.
2. Commit `src/generated/app.ts`.
3. Append ` && agentflow-app types --check` to the `test` script in `package.json`, after `agentflow-app build --check`,
   as `init` writes it: `vitest run && agentflow-app build --check && agentflow-app types --check`. A file that falls behind
   `package/` then fails `pnpm test` with `TYPES_STALE`.

A project with no UI module (`init --no-ui`) has no `src/generated/app.ts` and keeps `test` as it is: the starter gives
the file only to a project with a module, and `types --check` fails with `TYPES_STALE` when the file does not exist.
Skip step 3 there unless you run `types` and commit the file on purpose.
