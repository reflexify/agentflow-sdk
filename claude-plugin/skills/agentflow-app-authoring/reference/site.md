# The standalone site

`agentflow-app init` keeps a small web site beside the package unless you pass `--no-site`. It is a separate
program from the app package: people open it in a browser, sign in to AgentFlow through its server, and work tasks,
records and a workflow start there. The package (`config/`) and the UI module (`src/module/`) need none of it. Read
this page when you change anything under `server/`, `src/` (outside `src/module/`), `static/`, `scripts/` or
`test/`, or when the brief says "a site".

`init` has already written your names into the site: the app's name where the starter said "Case desk", your
package key where it said `case-desk` (the config route, the client id `<key>-dev`, the log prefix), and your key in
capitals with underscores in front of every environment variable (`<KEY>_ORIGIN`, `<KEY>_SESSION_KEY`,
`<KEY>_ENTITY_ID`, `<KEY>_WORKFLOW_ID`). The names are the only thing it changes. What stays case-specific is below.

## The files

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `server/app.ts`, `server/main.ts` | the Hono server: the SDK's sign-in and proxy (`/agentflow/...`), `GET /<key>/config.json`, `/plain`, the built site |
| `server/config.ts`, `server/checks.ts` | reads `.env`; `checks.ts` is what `pnpm check-setup` runs against the real stack |
| `server/vite-plugin.ts`, `vite.config.ts` | under `pnpm dev`, the same server inside Vite |
| `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/route.ts` | the page: the elements inside `<agentflow-provider>`, a hash route for Inbox, Records and Start |
| `src/StartCase.tsx` | the start screen: a form that starts a workflow |
| `src/text.ts` | every string, in English and Vietnamese |
| `scripts/setup.ts`, `scripts/doctor.ts`, `.env.example`, `RUNBOOK.md` | `pnpm setup-keys` (keys, `.env`, the registration body), `pnpm check-setup`, the settings, the step-by-step run against a real AgentFlow |

The site holds no token in the browser. The server keeps the session and signs the calls; the page and its elements
call `/agentflow/api/...` on the same origin.

## The start screen

A workflow whose input is a schema has no launch form for `<agentflow-start-form>` to draw, so
`src/StartCase.tsx` asks for the inputs itself and starts the run as the signed-in person through the proxy. It
shows the pattern to copy: one input per schema property, the refusal's `fieldErrors` placed under the field they
name, a banner for the rest, a guard against a double submit, and the access-lost codes handed up to `App.tsx`.
Its inputs, `summary` and `amount`, are the starter workflow's; a workflow with other inputs needs another form.

## Adapting it

Change these, in this order, when the app is not a case desk:

1. `src/StartCase.tsx`: the inputs, their validation, the run's name, and `startForm` in `src/text.ts`.
2. `src/App.tsx`: the Records screen's filter (`URGENT` is a field of the starter's entity and refuses on yours),
   the header and the routes.
3. The ids the site needs: `<KEY>_ENTITY_ID` and `<KEY>_WORKFLOW_ID` are read in `server/config.ts` and checked in
   `server/checks.ts`; the page gets them through `publicConfig` (also in `config.ts`), `src/main.tsx` and
   `src/App.tsx` (the `PublicConfig` interface and the not-configured message for each id). A new id
   is added in all of those, in `.env.example` and in `RUNBOOK.md`.
4. `RUNBOOK.md` step 4 and the walkthrough in step 6, which name the starter's entity, workflow and fields.
5. `static/plain.html`, the plain-HTML page, if you keep it.

`pnpm check-setup` and `pnpm test` then say what you missed.

## Its tests

`pnpm test` runs Vitest over `test/` and then `agentflow-app build --check`. `test/app.test.tsx` and
`test/main.test.tsx` render the page; `test/app.test.ts`, `test/config.test.ts` and `test/checks.test.ts` hold the
server, the settings and the checks; `test/setup.test.ts` the key script; `test/vite-plugin.test.ts` the dev
server; `test/plain.test.ts` and `test/styles.test.ts` the plain page and the styles.
They encode the starter's case: expect to rewrite the ones that name its entity, its fields and its start form
when you change them. `pnpm typecheck` covers the site and the module.

## The ceiling

An admin registers the site with a ceiling (Admin → Apps), and under a ceiling the site cannot fetch an entity's
create form: `GET /entities/{id}/create-form` answers `403 APP_CEILING_DENIED`, and "New record" is gone. That
is why the starter lets people start a workflow and does not offer a create form. What the site can still do, and the
level the ceiling needs for it, is in the authoring skill's `SKILL.md`, "What a ceiling takes from a standalone
site", and the workflow side in `workflows.md`, "Start forms". Decide it before you design how a person
creates anything.

`init --no-site` drops all of these files; `--no-ui` drops only the module and keeps the site. The release skill
says what else changes.
